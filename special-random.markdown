# Orutu

The **orutu** is a one-stringed fiddle native to western Kenya, especially 
amongst the [Luo][4] community.

The term also refers to a genre of music in Kenya which involves this instrument. 
The instrument is also a central part of the [benga][5] musical genre, with 
the band [Kenge Kenge Orutu System][6] being the most prolific users of the 
musical instrument.

This musical instrument is played a bit like a violin but has a different, 
more African sound to it. It is accompanied by drums and singing, but these 
instruments are not very popular as most of Kenya is quite poor and not many 
have the money to afford music lessons or even the instruments themselves. 
There aren't many teachers of this instrument either.
